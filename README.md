# CAPE Python Utilities

This repository contains a collection of utility functions useful for developing
on and interacting with the CAPE infrastructure. It basically provides an
abstraction layer over the core concepts such as ETL (extract, transform, load)
jobs and analysis pipelines that allow interacting with these types of
structures without worrying about the implementation details of each.
